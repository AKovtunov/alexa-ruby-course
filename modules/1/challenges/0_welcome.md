# 0. Welcome

Welcome to the Amazon Alexa Ruby challenges, module 1! By the end of this module, you will have enhanced any Alexa-enabled device by building a custom Skill. During the course of building this Skill, you will learn about:

- Intent Schemas
- Utterances
- Alexa communication paradigm
- Tunnelling a local application using ngrok over HTTPS
- Connecting Alexa to a local development environment
- Alexa-style JSON requests and responses

Each section of these challenges will contain a self-contained challenge, with a series of supporting steps to guide development. At any time, you can switch from the challenge to the corresponding walkthrough for that challenge.

The intention is to provide you a high-level goal, some shorter, easy-to-follow steps along the way to that goal, and a full guide. It's up to you how you use it.

This module is split into four challenges:

1. [Setting up a Skill through the Amazon Developer Portal](1_setting_up_a_new_skill.md)
2. [Setting up a local development server to which Amazon's Alexa Service can send requests, via a Tunnel](2_local_development_environment_setup.md)
3. [Linking Amazon's Alexa Service to our local development server](3_linking_amazon_to_our_endpoint.md)
4. [Responding to Alexa Requests](4_responding_to_alexa_requests.md)

Whenever you're ready, [head to the first challenge](1_setting_up_a_new_skill.md).

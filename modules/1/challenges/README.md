# Alexa Module 1: Challenges

This is a series of sequenced challenges that guides a developer through the process of building their first Alexa Skill.

Each challenge consists of a high-level goal, some support, links to relevant resources, and a walkthrough that takes them through the individual stage.

These challenges can be done solo or in a group session facilitated by a coach or presenter. They require minimal support and introduce all key Alexa concepts in a rigorous and entertaining way.
